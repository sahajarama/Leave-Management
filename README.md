Leave Management System
This project is a simple, web-based Leave Management System built using a native Java HTTP server. It provides a basic interface for employees to log in, submit leave requests, and for a manager to view all submitted requests. The system is designed to be a lightweight, self-contained application without external frameworks.

Features
Login Page: A basic HTML form for employees to log in with their name and employee ID.
Leave Request Form: A form for employees to submit a reason for their leave.
View Requests Page: A table-based page that displays all submitted leave requests.

In-Memory Storage: The application uses a simple ArrayList to store leave requests, meaning the data is temporary and will be lost when the server is stopped.
